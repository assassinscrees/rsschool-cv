#About myself

![Avatar][def2]

I am **Vladislav Petrushckevich**. I am 23 years old, belarus. I live in *Pinsk*.

I graduated from **Brest State University named after A.S. Pushkin**, the faculty of foreign languages. There, in addition to my main profession, *linguist, tutor of two foreign languages*, i got a speciality called *computer linguistics*. 

The main idea of it is to know how to work with electronic dictionaries, create them by myself, operate with linguistic analysis and so on. Also got some basic knowledge about css and JavaScript in order to create different tasks for future students.
